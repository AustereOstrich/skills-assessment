## Skills Assessment

Fork the repo and create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the widget as described in the [Contact List image](https://github.com/14four/skills-assessment/blob/master/contactListUpdated.jpg).  It should take you about 3 hours, but you should try and complete it without taking an entire day. You will be asked to explain any places where your solution does not match the spec.  Please target modern browsers, do not use images, and bonus points for graceful degradation and legacy support solutions.  We wish to assess your CSS skills, so don't use a CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, they have their place, but this is not it. JQuery is not needed to complete this exercise, we would like to assess your Javascript skills without the use of this library. 

Please code the page according to industry best practices and organize the assets as you would if delivering it to a client to integrate (not necessarily to deploy).

Bonuses: Keep it simple, don't overuse JavaScript.  Prioritize modern browsers - graceful degredation is our friend.

###*Notes

The only piece of the assessment that I did not manage was mirroring the formatting for the contact detail breakout; I wasn't sure how to best replicate what is seen in the image, where the details spill out in the second column of the contact table without removing the rest of the elements in that column or resizing the first (name) column. Maybe it would have been easier if I hadn't used an html table...?

Regardless, I think I was able to manage a functional replica of the rest of the page without overusing javascript or keeping the site from remaining relatively simple.
